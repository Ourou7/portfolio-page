# Portfolio Page

## Description

The week 2 challenge of this bootcamp was to build a skeleton portfolio page to use for display of my completed projects on github

To complete this task, I built a skeleton HTML page with a header, footer, and grid section to display my work, and linked this to a functional CSS sheet.
